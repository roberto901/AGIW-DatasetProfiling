These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture.

The Alpine car speaker can supply up to 40 watts of RMS power and 200 watts of peak handling power. As a non-powered speaker, the two-way car speaker relies on an external power source to create the high and mid-range sounds intended to come from this unit. The 6.75-inch Alpine car speaker has a 4-Ohm dual-coil impedance and a 92 dB sensitivity. The unit consists of a metal woofer, rubber surround, and neodymium magnet. The unit is a non-enclosed speaker, meaning that it does not come preset in a speaker box. It must be set in a box as a standalone speaker or as part of a speaker set. The Alpine car speaker requires a top mounting depth of 2.25 inches and a mounting hole size of 4.92 inches. This means the box will need a back-to-front clearance greater than 2.25 inches and a hole diameter of 4.92 inches for the speaker to sit correctly. The Alpine SPS-170A car speaker uses a minimum frequency response of 35 Hz and a maximum frequency response of 30 kHz. The two-way car speaker has a 6.5-inch woofer and 0.5-inch tweeter.\nProduct Identifiers BrandAlpine ModelSPS-170A MPNSPS-170A UPC793276600943\nKey Features Car Speaker FunctionMid-Range Speaker, Tweeter Size6.75" TypeCoaxial Elements2-Way PoweredNon-Powered RMS Power40 W\nTechnical Features Min Frequency Response35 Hz Max Frequency Response30 kHz Impedance4 ohm Sensitivity92 dB Peak Power Handling200 watt\nMounting Top Mounting Depth2.25 in.

Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 image processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations, and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system compensates for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur, and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The result is images that are reliably sharp and clear at all lengths of the camera's powerful zoom. The processor's highly efficient design also extends battery life.", 1)

www.ebay.com	optical image stabilizer			("Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.", 13)	("An optical image stabilizer makes this camera's performance really stand out. Compensating for camera shake in challenging conditions such as lower light or when shooting with the longer end of the zoom range, the Image Stabilizer helps you capture images in full detail and with less blur at all times.", 11)	('Delivers clear, blur-free image quality in low light or when the camera shakes, without the use of a tripod. Plus, you have Intelligent IS to automatically select from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the given situation: Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS for stills; and Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS for video. Dynamic IS, effective at wide-angle focal lengths, has been improved, now compensating for rotational movement centered on the optical axis in addition to horizontal tilt and vertical pitch. Panning ensures IS does not interfere with camera movement. Hybrid corrects for shift-type camera shake that normally occurs during macro shooting. Powered mode compensates for hand movement at telephoto focal lengths, where camera shake gets magnified. Tripod mode automatically stops the IS system when tripod use is detected, because it is no longer necessary', 1)

The equivalent focal lengths of this 24x super zoom for photo and video range from a super wide-angle 25mm to an extreme telephoto of 600mm in 35mm format. This makes the Leica V-LUX 2 a true all-round genius - and the perfect camera for any situation. Its super zoom lens ensures pin-sharp pictures from finely detailed macro close-ups and breathtaking wide-angle vistas to super telephoto shots - and ideal camera, particularly for travel and nature photography. Thanks to its enormous zoom range, the V-LUX 2 opens up almost infinite photographic opportunities without any need to change a lens, and makes it an interesting alternative to comparable SLR systems with interchangeable lenses. In addition to its enormous range of focal lengths, another compelling feature of the compact V-LUX 2 is its newly developed high-performance, 14.1-megapixel, CMOS image sensor.', 3)

The Lumix GF2 features My Color mode which is integrated with the conventional Film mode. My Color mode offers a total of eight preset effects - expressive, retro, pure, elegant, cinema, monochrome, dynamic art, silhouette, plus custom mode, which lets users manually set the color, brightness, saturation and contrast levels. Also, with the Full-time Live View function, users can see how these settings will affect the images before they shoot, which makes it easier to capture the exact effect desired. The Lumix GF2 has 17 Scene modes, most which can be used during video shooting, too. The exposure meter can be displayed in the P/A/S/M shooting modes for entry-level users to learn the correlation between shutter speed and aperture visually to enhance their photography skills.', 7)

Also, with DIGIC II, higher resolution and high-speed processing were achieved and the startup time and response time were shortened.This camera is equipped with a 12x optical zoom lens, which covers a 35mm film equivalent focal length ranging from 36 mm (Wide Angle) to 432 mm (Telephoto), and has an f/2.7 (Wide Angle) - f/3.5 (Telephoto) aperture. By incorporating a UD (Ultra Low Dispersion) lens into the lens element, the chromatic aberration has been reduced. This model incorporates an image stabilizer, which reduces the effects of camera shake while shooting. In addition, the zoom lens\'s super-smooth, super-fast ultra sonic motor (USM) provides all the zooming speed you need.This camera can take VGA (640 x 480 pixels) movies with exceptional image quality at a full 30 frames per second. Furthermore, it can shoot movies even in the still image shooting modes and vice versa. Also, a new mode to take very smooth QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) movies at 60 frames per second has been newly added. Moreover, digital zoom and manual focus are available as well as adjusting the zoom or exposure, or locking the AF or exposure while shooting a movie. Movies can be taken continuously (depending on the storage capacity of the recording media) until the clip size reaches 1GB or the clip length reaches 1 hour.The recording pixels include a "Widescreen" feature that has the same aspect ratio as 16:9 widescreen TVs for shooting wide images. Adding ISO [800] has resulted in a faster shutter speed even when shooting in dark environments. Also, [High ISO Auto] that has a program diagram with a higher ISO speed setting has been added to the ISO speed position.Featuring "Sports" as a shooting mode has resulted in better focusing of moving subjects, which is especially useful when shooting sporting events. A "My Colors" mode that changes image colors when shooting has been added to the FUNC. Menu of the PowerShot S3 IS.Macro mode is used to record subjects at close range, and Super Macro is used when the distance from the front of the lens to the subject is in the range of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 3.9 in.).This camera is equipped with an upgraded 2.0-inch Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Information display on the LCD monitor and LCD viewfinder when shooting can be customized. The function (shooting mode: P/Tv/Av/M) to display the histogram when shooting was added and Grid lines can be displayed for easier photo composition. Also, this camera shows the possible shooting range within which auto-focusing at the current zoom position.As the recording quality is set up to 16 bit, 44.100 k Hz with the stereo microphone, high quality recording is possible when shooting movies. In addition, "Sound Recorder" can record sound only, without images.Using My Colors, effects can be added to images that have already been shot (still images only). The functions to create a folder to store recorded images by shooting date or shooting month, and to jump to the first image of each shooting date or to a movie and play have been newly added. Transition effects can be applied while transitioning between scenes or on slide shows.A Print/Share button has also been equipped, letting you easily print your images by connecting the camera directly to a direct print compatible printer and then simply pressing this button. When the camera is connected to a computer, pressing the Print/Share button lets you easily download images directly from the camera to the computer.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelS3 IS MPN1101B001\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom12x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution6.0 MP Screen Size2"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range0-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera36 - 432mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/3200 sec Min Shutter Speed15 sec Exposure compensationÂ±2 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative, Spot, spot AF area Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 80, ISO 800, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max800\nCamera Flash Flash TypePop-up Flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.5 m - 5.2 m Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator, Auto Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Auto Mode With Red-eye Reduction, Fill-in Mode, Flash ON Mode, OFF mode, Rear Curtain Sync, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryMultiMediaCard, SD Card, SD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeElectronic, Optical (Through-the-lens) Viewfinder - Field Coverage100% Viewfinder Diagonal Size0.33" Dioptric Correction Range-5.5 to +1.5\nDimensions Depth2.97 in.

At the same time, a highly accurate 2016-pixel RGB sensor evaluates every scene, taking into account brightness, contrast, subject distance and color, for spot-on auto operations like Face-Priority and full-time autofocus during video capture.', 43)

The EXPEED 3 image-processing engine effortlessly handles the sensor's large data files, while in-camera Picture Control tailors the individual look and feel of your stills and videos. These four assets are vital elements for creating the images you want.\nThanks to the high-speed performance of the EXPEED 3 image-processing engine and an exclusive driving mechanism that drives the mirror independently, the D610 is capable of high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 6 fps in FX format, for up to 100 shots.\nThe D610's optical viewfinder features approx. 100% frame coverage that enables confirmation of the entire large image area of FX format for precise composition. And approx. 0.7x* magnification allows easy viewing of all the visual elements including the viewfinder information display. The frame coverage and magnification are the same as those of the D4 and D3 series, realizing comfortable shooting.\nThe Nikon FX-format CMOS sensor (35.9 x 24.0 mm) with 24.3 effective megapixels delivers stable, high image quality.\nEXPEED 3 image-processing engine, the same as used for the D4 and D800 series, realizes superior high-speed processing performance.\nThe D610's Picture Control system lets you fine-tune sharpening, contrast, saturation, hue, and various adjustments for Monochrome, etc. in both still images and movies according to your preference.\nThe D610's new Qc (quiet continuous) shutter-release mode reduces mirror noise while still offering up to 3 fps*, for maximum discretion.\n*Based on CIPA Guidelines.\nWith seven focus points compatible with f/8, precise focusing is possible even when attaching a 2.0x teleconverter to telephoto lenses with a maximum aperture of f/4.\nScene Recognition System recognizes the subject's situation accurately prior to shooting and enables precise auto control.\nInheriting an array of specifications and functions equivalent to those of the D4 and D800 series, the D610 combines them in a remarkably small and light camera body.\nSD memory card double slots compatible with high-speed SDXC and UHS-I.\nTime-lapse photography lets you shoot automatically at designated intervals and save as a movie to replay slow-moving activity at high speed.\nThe D610's built-in flash incorporates a commander function that supports Advanced Wireless Lighting.\nINSIDE THE PACKAGENikon D610 Digital SLR Camera Body Only Black * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.
